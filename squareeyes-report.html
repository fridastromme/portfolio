				<h1>Report: Square Eyes</h1>
				<h2>
					When I started developing Square Eyes almost a year ago, I had no
					frontend experience. Since then, the site has been through several
					rounds of improvements.
				</h2>
				<p>
					I had a lot of fun designing Square Eyes in the design course at the
					beginning of the year. I didn't know the limitations at the time, or
					where I would meet challenges when developing the site. I a sense,
					this was a good thing, because it forced me to go into a steep
					learning curve, and I developed my skills quickly during the initial
					process of creating the site with HTML and CSS.
				</p>
				<h3>Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					I went back to the last submission of the site and looked at the
					feedback I got on the assignment. From there I used what I learned
					during the Exam 1 period, and created a modal for the infobox that
					pops up when you click the featured movie. The information here is
					also dynamically created through Wordpress REST API. This means that
					when updating the featured movie in Wordpress, the information modal
					will also be automatically updated, which is practical. The rest of
					the movies are also dynamically fetched from Wordpress' Woocommerce.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meta titles and meta descriptions are also dynamically updated through
					the API depending on which movie you click on. This way, you don't
					need to hard code each of these every time you make a change in the
					lists of movies.
				</p>
				<p>
					I used JavaScript to change the styling of the hover states when
					hovering over the movie image. Earlier, the styling of the movie
					titles would only change when hovering over the title itself. This is
					more pleasing and less confusing for the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the purchase movie page, I added a shadow to the purchase
					information section in order to highlight this more. I also adapted
					the page better to smaller screens, and the layout changes from a two
					column grid to a one column grid depending on the screen width.
				</p>
				<p>
					The user profile pages had a lot of static pixel widts defined on the
					different sections, which made these pages adapt poorly to different
					screen widths. I changed the widts to percentages and max-widths
					instead. This really improved how the different sections adapted to
					different screen sizes.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also added some subtle animations to some of the elements on the
					site. Like a zoom effect when hovering over the different movie images
					to further indicate that these are clickable. These small movements
					are also meant to be more pleasing for the user, and are intended to
					make it more interesting to click these elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					I tidied up the header and footer navigations by aligning the elements
					better. I also improved the alignment on some of the call to action
					buttons, both on the front page and on the user profiles. These also
					have an improved color contrast. The navigation on the sign up and
					sign in pages are also improved for assistive technology by adding
					aria-labels for easier navigation between the different sections.
				</p>
				<p>
					The forms should also now be labeled correctly, with a for attribute
					pointing to the id of the input. This way, the user knows which input
					the label refers to.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the different rounds of improving the Square Eyes site, I've
					both been adding and removing classes and ids. I took some time to
					clean up and remove the ones who weren't used anymore. The code is now
					simplified compared to earlier versions, which makes it easier to
					develop further and gives me a better overview.
				</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					This project is especially characterized by the fact that I learned
					the very basics of frontend development while creating the site from
					scratch. This means that several places I needed to spend some time
					understanding what I intented to do at the time. A portion of the
					improvements consisted of cleaning up the classes and simplifying the
					elements. I still think that further improvements could be made in
					this area. There might also be some places where small adjustments to
					margins and paddings would improve the design even further. At this
					point in time, I think Square Eyes has improved significantly and it
					is a testament to how much I've learned during one year.
