				<h1>Report: Community Science Museum</h1>
				<h2>
					I didn't have any experience working with JavaScript when first
					developing my semester project. A large part of the improvements done
					on this site consisted of implementing Wordpress REST API.
				</h2>
				<p>
					After delivering this project, I got some very helpful and detailed
					feedback. The first thing I did when revisiting this project, was to
					go improve these areas. I then went on to implement JavaScript for
					REST API and form validation.
				</p>
				<h3>Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					Earlier, all the images and text on the news and exhibition sections
					was hard coded onto the site. I used what I learned during the
					JavaScript and CRM courses to fetch images and text from Wordpress
					while also automatically updating meta titles and meta descriptions.
					Now, all the exhibition categories are dynamically created and can
					easily be updated through Wordpress. They also have their own
					dynamically created page. I also added new images to each page
					(soruces below). I removed arrows and instead added a hover animation
					to indicate that the user can click to view more. I think it looks
					tidier and the movement is more pleasing. The color palette is also
					made less childlike by only having one color on the category divs. I
					figured the circles were playful enough by themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					I added form validation on the contact form as well, with error
					messages showing if the user type in an invalid input. When the user
					has typed in all the required inputs and clicket "submit", a feedback
					message will appear, telling the user that the message was
					successfully sent. Unlike before, the user now recieves expected
					validation when interacting with the form, which is important for user
					experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					The logo now includes a logotype as well, to make it clearer for the
					user which website they are on. "Community Science Museum" is a long
					name, so I decided to only include the initials and expect this to be
					sufficient and a reasonable compromise between providing information
					while still maintaining a clean design.
				</p>
				<p>
					The arrows on some of the links are essentially images, so I added
					aria-labels as suggested in the feedback. This way, users with
					assistive technology can navigate better.
				</p>
				<p>
					The links and buttons have now changed color to improve contrast. The
					call to action button in the header is wrapped inside a li element,
					and should now be semantically correct. The read more-links are now
					easier to spot by including a border on the bottom. All the pages now
					also includes a skip to main content link, so that people using
					assistive technology can skip repeating content.
				</p>
				<p>
					A smaller but still significant change was fixing the font paths and
					also adding alternative fonts. The fonts weren't loading properly onto
					the page before, but this should now work as inteded.
				</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					When developing this project the first time, I had a better
					understanding of the limitations of HTML and CSS. This made the
					process more structural and less complicated than the cross course
					project from earier. I was initially quite happy with the result, but
					through self assessment and feedback I saw where I could make changes
					both in the design and in the code. Now that I have some grasp on
					JavaScript and Wordpress REST API, I could make some significant and
					practical changes to the site. Being able to update the exhibition and
					news-sites through a CRM makes it easier to work with for both the
					developer and other stakeholders.
