				<h1>Report: ByWay</h1>
				<h2>
					After assessing my work through writing the report for Exam 1 and
					recieving feedback on the delivery, I've made some improvements on the
					site.
				</h2>
				<p>
					Developing ByWay consisted for a lot of trial and error on several
					areas. I had to find solutions for challenges such as creating a
					carousel and an image modal. This had me trying out different
					solutions until it worked as intended. As I also mentioned in the exam
					report, some of these solutions could still use some small
					improvements in order to work better. I also wanted to make the
					website slightly more interesting by introducing a small design change
					that would still have some significance on the overall look of the
					site.
				</p>
				<h3>Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					By adjusting the background-color to a brighter tone, I intended to
					make the website more visually appealing. I also added a simple svg
					graphic in the background on the front page in order to make the
					design more interesting and inspiring. This is supposed to point to
					the theme of travelling and landscapes by imitating lines on a map or
					cracks on the side of a mountain. The svg also has a subtle movement.
					Many users will probably not spot the animation, but I think this
					works as an interesting addition.
				</p>
				<p>
					The HTML had some unclosed tags, which I improved. The skip to main
					content-link didn't work because it was linking to a class. Now it
					links to an id and should work as intended. Some of the headings
					wasn't in correct order, and this is now fixed. The website are now
					improved in regards to WCAG guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the elements on the site was a little too snug on different
					screen sizes. For example, the carousel got quite narrow before the
					media quiery that changed the grid columns cicked in. The stories page
					also created a horizontal scrollbar on a narrower width. I improved
					these areas by including them in an earlier media quiery.
				</p>
				<p>
					This time around I was able to fix the load more-link after loading
					all the posts in the stories page. Earlier, the link would still be
					visible even though all the posts were loaded onto the page. I worked
					around this by creating an if statement that removed the link if the
					number of posts were 18. This means that when adding more posts, the
					load more-link will still be removed after 18 posts, which I realise
					isn't ideal.
				</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					I spent most of my time during these two weeks improving Square Eyes
					and Community Science Museum, and needed to realise some of my
					limitations while working on ByWay. Ideally, I would like to write a
					code to check the length of the posts array, and removing the
					load-more button dynamically. And I would like to attempt level 2. I'm
					still content with the result, and I'm happy with the improvements I
					made so far. The exam was challenging and developing this project
					helped me practice my skills in JavaScript and Wordpress REST API.
